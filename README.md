Web Development Checklist
This is a list of basic objectives to meet on the road to mastering web development.

It is an almost exact copy of Ginny Fahs' "Things Real Developers Do: My Bucket List"

 Open the computer’s terminal
 Use a text editor (bonus points if you have a specific reason for choosing it)
 Use some keyboard shortcuts
 Write tests for your code
 Help another web developer with something they’re having trouble with
 Attend an event about web development
 Follow developers you admire on social media
 Read a book about coding
 Open your browser console
 Get data from an API
 Hide API keys from the public
 Post a question on Stack Overflow
 Push code to GitHub or GitLab or BitBucket
 Speak about something web development-related at an event
 Complete a technical interview
 Participate in a hackathon
 Deploy a project
 Ship your project to a store
 Contribute to open source
 Get paid to code
 When people ask what you do, respond saying you’re a developer :)
If you find this useful for your own needs you are welcome to fork a copy, customise it or even give it a star.

You can follow me on Twitter or get in touch
